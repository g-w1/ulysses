# Ulysses

A tool for creating simple [ulysses pacts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ulysses_pact).
Let's say you know that you won't shutdown your computer when you finish doing something. This basically tells your future self too bad and runs a command anyways. Inspired by advice in Atomic Habits.
